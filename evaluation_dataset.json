    "question": "Both the green flash and Fata Morgana are atmospheric mirages. How do their formation mechanisms differ, particularly in terms of the required atmospheric condition and the visual result?",
    "reference_answer": "The green flash is caused by the refraction and scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere when the sun is on the horizon, creating a brief, colorful point of light. Conversely, the Fata Morgana is a superior mirage requiring a strong thermal inversion layer to form an atmospheric duct where light rays bend stronger than the Earth's curvature, resulting in a complex, sustained distortion of distant objects into stacked, rapidly changing images.",
